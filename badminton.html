    <h2>Origins of Badminton</h2>
    <p>
      In a very basic summary, badminton is a court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock.
      </br>
      The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it
      was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is
      closely related to the old childrenâ€™s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona,
      which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s.
