      <h2> A Brief History of Football</h2>
      <p>"To English-speaking countries outside America, terms like 'American football' and 'gridiron' were used instead
        of just football. Although there are some mentions of Native Americans playing football-like games, modern
        American football has its origins in the traditional football games played in the cities, villages and schools
        of Europe for many centuries before America was settled by Europeans. Early games appear to have had much in
        common with the traditional "mob football" played in England. The games remained largely unorganized until the
        18th century, when intramural games of football began to be played. Organized varieties of football began to
        take form in 19th century in English public schools. According to legend, William Webb Ellis picked up the ball
        and ran with it during a school football match in 1823, thus creating a new style of play in which running with
        the ball predominated instead of kicking. Football soon began to be played at colleges and universities in the
        United States. "

      <h2>History of the NFL</h2>
      <p>On August 20, 1920, at a Hupmobile dealership in Canton, Ohio, the league was formalized, originally as the
        American Professional Football Conference, initially consisting only of the Ohio League teams, although some of
        the teams declined participation.
        One month later on September 17, the league was renamed the American Professional Football Association, adding
        Buffalo and Rochester from the New York league, and Detroit, Hammond (a suburban Chicago squad), and several
        other teams from nearby circuits.
        Only four of the founding teams finished the 1920 schedule and the undefeated Akron Pros claimed the first
        championship.
        Membership of the league increased to 22 teams – including more of the New York teams – in 1921, but throughout
        the 1920s the membership was unstable and the league was not a major national sport.
        On June 24, 1922, the organization, now headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, changed its title a final time to the
        National Football League.</p>
